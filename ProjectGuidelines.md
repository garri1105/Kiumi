# Project Guidelines:

## Communication:

Exclusively Slack. Use @channel **only** for emergencies. Bret and the preceptors don't need to get notifications for 
everything we type. Set up your notifications preferences to **"all messages"** instead of **"just mentions"**

## Meetings:

We'll be meeting all Monday's and Wednesday, we will report our progress, answer questions and work on our assigned task

## Tasks:

I will be giving you tasks to accomplish. You will be the temporary owner of specific files. All others that I don't 
list will be out of reach meaning you **shouldn't** touch them. Even if you think that there is something you could 
indent or add a new line to, don't touch it. This avoids scary merge conflicts that can screw the whole project up. 
When you finish the task you will:

1.  Slack the whole team
2.  Commit
3.  Pull
4.  Resolve conflicts
5.  Run the app. Make sure nothing breaks
6.  Push
7.  Slack team again

## Workrate:

Additionally to the work we get done in the meetings we will ideally work at least 4 hours on our own per week. This 
should be a good amount but keep in mind that that number could increase or decrease depending on your task. More often 
than not we'll need to work more.

## Questions:

If you have **any** sort of questions, worries, problems with your IDE, git commands, etc. I will always be available 
through Slack. No question is a bad question if it's going to get you out of a hole. This is a college class after all 
and we are all learning here. If you get stuck on something please contact me right away. Getting stuck is frustrating 
and it will want to make you quit and postpone your work. We all struggle with procrastinating so keep in mind that in 
this case it not only hurts you but your teammates as well.
